# Inclusion_by_Design
Can government institutions be intentionally designed to be more inclusive? By comparing voting data with census data from Trinidad and Tobago, we are able to utilize ecological inference analysis to better understand what demographics vote and how they vote. Aggregate level community data grouped by demographic indicators such as ethnicity and religion are utilized in order to draw individual level behavioral conclusions. Inclusion in government can be broadly defined as achieving minority groups access to the dominant coalition. Final results are still pending.
